    "### 1. (a) Naive Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method we will use is naive Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo estimates the expected value of a function of a random variable. The probability a random variable is greater than two can be written as an expectation of a function of a random variable --- it is the expected number of times that the random variable is greater than two if we drew a lot of samples from the distribution. So, $P(Y > 2) = E[I(Y>2)]$, where $I(\\cdot)$ is an indicator function, which returns 1 when its argument is true and 0 otherwise.\\footnote{In your favorite programming language, it is easy to calculate the probability that a standard normal distribution is greater than two --- e.g., simply run {\\tt 1-normcdf(2,0,1) = 0.0228} in Matlab. However, I want you to implement these estimators to get a feel for how they behave.} \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code that samples $T$ standard normally distributed variables $x_{MC}^{(1)},\\ldots, x_{MC}^{(T)} \\sim N(0,1)$. Create a vector which cumulatively estimates the Monte Carlo estimate of the probability of seeing a value greater than two after observing each subsequent data point. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, create a vector ${\\bf f}_{MC}$ such that the value of element $t$ in ${\\bf f}_{MC}$ is the Markov Carlo estimate of the probability that a standard normal randomly generated value is greater than 2 from $t$ samples (the number of samples in $x_{MC}^{(1)},\\ldots, x_{MC}^{(t)}$ that are greater than 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Plot ${\\bf f}_{MC}$ vector. Is there anything strange about it? (Does it look like the example we did in class of the Monte Carlo estimate of the average number of dots seen when you roll a die?) Write 1-2 sentences explaining why the plot of the updated Monte Carlo estimate looks the way it does. Also report the final estimate according to the Monte Carlo estimate ($f_{MC}(T)$)."

    "The second method we will use is called {\\em importance sampling}. This is another method for estimating the expectation of a function of a random variable. Rather than using the distribution of the random variable itself to generate samples, it uses a different distribution ($q$ -- called the {\\em proposal} distribution)\\footnote{If you are curious why we use $q$ instead of $p$ for the probability under the proposal distribution, at least one reason is to remind us that $q$ is not the actual probability., Rather, it is a surrogate that we are using as part of our approximation method.} and then re-weights each sample by how probable they would have been under the true distribution. So, if $x_{IS}^{(1)},\\dotsc,x_{IS}^{(T)}$ are my $T$ samples generated from distribution $q$ rather than $p$, my estimate would be\n",

Because we are interested in the probability $X > 2$, lets use a distribution that is closer to 2:  $q=N(2,1)$.   So, samples from the proposal distribution come from $N(2,1)$ (a normal distribution with a mean of 2 and variance of 1). This can be drawn from a standard normal distribution (N(0,1)) from by adding two to a random variable generated from standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve the problem then is to sample each data point from $q$ and then use a function that returns the probability density of some value under a Normal distribution with a specified mean and variance. Alternatively, you could divide $p$ by $q$ explicitly. The explicit solution is\n",
